I work with organizations to face the challenges that come along with operating in a complex, changing world. I have worked extensively with many organizations over the past 10 years on a variety of change projects. These can take a number of forms depending on the perceived urgency and desired extent of transformation. A good way to get started is via an introductory workshop as a way to become familiar with the methodology.

If you're interested in working with me, I encourage you to [contact me](mailto:hello@ryanarmstrong.me).



## In-house consulting

Change is the only constant, so they say, but unfortunately resisting it comes rather naturally to most of us.
With the rate of social and technological change increasing year over year, sustainable teams will be those who can change most effectively.
How can you do that?
I work with organizations and teams large and small to address this complex challenge using inclusive, participatory techniques.  

## Co-Visioning

The most sustainable and most powerful strategies are those that draw on the collective intelligence of the entire organization. But gathering that information is not easy. I can help change leaders listen.

## Systems Thinking Workshops

Scientists are increasingly in agreement that everything is connected.
Systems thinking workshops are useful for combating things.
They can be used in conflict management, or when a diverse group of stakeholders need to work together on a project.

## Visual Facilitation

Need to organize a team meeting?

## Training

I offer customized training on areas of project management, organizational learning, supervisor management, and positive practice.
