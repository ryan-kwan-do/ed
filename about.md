 I work with organizations to learn about complex problems and what can be done at them. My research interests lie in the challenges relating to the 4th Industrial revolution---a period of intense technological and societal change. My focus is on navigating that change, whether through research or practice.

 A description of my research activity is on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryan_Armstrong4) and [here](/research.html).

### Current Projects

I also help organizations define performance and how to improve it. I have experience working with a number of organizations such as [HireMojo](https://hiremojo.com) and [Accolo Business Services](https://accolo.com), now a part of Orion Novotus, helping to simplify big data and communicate it to make better decisions. I am also Treasurer at [Science Dating Forum](http://scientistsdatingforum.org/), a group dedicated to increasing connections between researching scientists and the community.
