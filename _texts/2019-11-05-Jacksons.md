I was looking for real-world examples of applications of a technique by Jackson (1956) that is supposed to be useful for sequencing on 2 machines where the order depends on the characteristics of the product (it can be Machine A, then Machine B, Machine A only, Machine B Only, or Machine B, then Machine A).  What is an example of when this might be useful? I thought about it for a good long while, consulted a text book, and found an example about patient check ups that include blood work and that have a one-day turnaround.

Surely there must have been some other situation in which this technique had been applied, for it to wind up in the core curriculum for operations management?

After some more digging, I found, to my dismay but not surprise, the following quote on Jackson's technique[^fn1]:

<blockquote>
Allowing for the usual time-lag before theory is put into practice, the scheduling techniques for small numbers of machines may eventually be of value in some actual situations. The analysis of simple cases has not, however, shed much light on approaches to the larger problem.
</blockquote>

Perhaps someone, somewhere, found its value, and simply chose not to share it.
