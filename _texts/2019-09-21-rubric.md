Good rubrics are hard to find (at least via Google).
After several hours and evaluating several dozens of university-level Rubrics I noted the following:

1. Many offered entirely subjective criteria
1. These subjective criteria were linked to a quantitative measure (the final grade)
1. Several contained categories, but not how to make a good grade
1. Many contained seemingly arbitrary categories of assessment

This level of ambiguity would be hard on the students (even if it might approximate "real-world" conditions). 
In searching for a rubric capable of offering a greater degree of goal clarity, I finally found the following set of rubrics by the [The Association of American Colleges and Universities](https://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics).

It's free, it's adaptable to context and assignment, and it contains instructions for how to combine the different rubrics.
