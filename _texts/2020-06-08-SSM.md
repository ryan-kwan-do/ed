I have been incorporating Checkland's soft systems into my introductory lessons in Operations Management. To me the approach is one of the most accessible means of applying systems thinking in practice, once you get the hang of it.

It is the "getting the hang of it" that gives people trouble with SSM. Now, Checkland and crew were well aware of this, and eventually offered a "Definitive account of Soft Systems" [^fn1]. However, even if this text is clear enough, we face two problems in using SSM with the uninitiated (like undergraduate business students):
1. Learners of SSM have told me that the interrelated steps and concepts of SSM are hard to grasp. It is hard to know how to start "doing" SSM.
2. The principles that inform SSM practices take time to understand, and time is lacking

After trying out a number of approaches, I eventually decided to write my own guide, available <a href="assets/pdfSSMWalktrhough.pdf/">here</a>.
