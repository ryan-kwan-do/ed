The work of Chris Argyris is some of my favorite for explaining barriers to learning and growth in organizations, as summarized [in this post](http://www.aral.com.au/resources/argyris.html). It's a theory I see supported by practice every day.
But after reading another of his books, I was still having trouble understanding what an Argyris-informed organizational intervention might look like.

There are marvelous descriptions in his books of the state of the art, of techniques for uncovering incongruities between espoused values and theories-in-use, and for conducting research in organizations in general. But I couldn't find much in terms of, once identified, what to do to achieve Model II. It was troubling, because Model I is presented in overwhelmingly negative terms and as a major barrier to positive change.

I found his advice today[^fn1]:

<blockquote>
I cannot, to date, conceive of a process that 'unfreezes' some designs-in-use that are already programmed. I believe that a more accurate explanation will someday be shown to be that unfreezing means that individuals become aware of their skilled incompetence and skilled lack of awareness.
</blockquote>


His point is rather to provide an alternative:

<blockquote>
This provides human beings with two degrees of freedom in choosing how they will act. Model I, for example, may be preferred when learning single-loop skills that are part of the existing routines.
</blockquote>

The advice for intervening then seems to be to use techniques that help uncover Model I theories-in-use so we can support Model II should we so choose.
But it's not an all or nothing event as it appears in much of his and Donald Sch√∂n's writing. Model II becomes something akin to [enlightenment](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/does-enlightenment-pass-t_b_8330548?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKrVhGW2uhyV4Ar1vimpsyopL35Ze7YbCE95qvsWbfXv-e27L6obqyCRhrxvp0M5nZHXUVTPEH6mF4gN4DT98yVisi1k6wH3ANVFqRUcaY-SoFH3ER_ufFEtj0thvkpiL4Ww4M5_Wvhh1VdqHPUcUuOqvZmdHt4ppg_NB_h-xHkX) in many ways:  there are debates around the proper practices to achieve it, most people won't get all the way there, the nature of the end-goal isn't clear, and a good number of people don't care.

Moreover, if Model I is our default mode of operation, then we would be wise not to treat it as something negative.
