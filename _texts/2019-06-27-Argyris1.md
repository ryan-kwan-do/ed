The work of Chris Argyris is some of my favorite for explaining barriers to learning and growth in organizations, as summarized [in this post](http://www.aral.com.au/resources/argyris.html).
But after reading another of his books, I was still having trouble understanding what an Argyris-informed organizational intervention might look like.

There are marvelous descriptions in his books of the state of the art, of techniques for uncovering conflict between espoused values and theories-in-use, and for researching in general. But I couldn't find much in terms of, once found, what to do with them.

I found his advice today[^fn1]:

<blockquote>
I cannot, to date, conceive of a process that 'unfreezes' some designs-in-use that are already programmed. I believe that a more accurate explanation will someday be shown to be that unfreezing means that individuals become aware of their skilled incompetence and skilled lack of awareness.
</blockquote>


His point is rather to provide an alternative:

<blockquote>
This provides human beings with two degrees of freedom in choosing how they will act. Model I, for example, may be preferred when learning single-loop skills that are part of the existing routines.
</blockquote>

The advice, then, apart from action science, is to use techniques that help uncover Model I theories-in-use so we can support Model II. But it's not an all or nothing event as it appears in much of his and Donald Sch√∂n's writing. Model II, like Buddhist Enlightenment or Skeptic Ataraxia, is not something we are likely to achieve. Rather his exercises are more like mindful practice in the sense that they can lead to Model II.
